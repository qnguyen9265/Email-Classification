Hello,

I hope you’re having a great fall semester! I wanted to share that Publix’s 2023 Summer Internship Program is around the corner and internship positions will be posted in February. 

If you are not familiar, Publix hosts a cohort of interns each summer, from May to July, throughout many different corporate departments. Interns work 40 hours a week and receive competitive pay. Some of our popular internship programs include the following:
Accounting
Business Analysis & Reporting
Legal
Human Resources
Information Technology
Loss Prevention
Manufacturing
Marketing
Public Affairs
Real Estate
Additionally, we provide free housing to out-of-town interns throughout the length of the program! To qualify, interns must be bachelor or graduate level degree-seeking students enrolled in college through the duration of the program. 

If you would like to learn more about our internships, please fill out this quick 2 minute form to tell us more about your interest.

I look forward to keeping you updated about our internship opportunities!
