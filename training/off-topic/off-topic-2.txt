Hey!

Today I’m going to…

Unveil the faces and name of the new Virtuoso deck series
​
Announce the 5 winners of an autographed deck
​
And do our next round of giving!
​
But before that, I have to say this:

WOW.

I did not expect SO MANY of you to reply to my last email. I literally got 4-5 times the replies I was hoping for. (And I was hoping for a lot.)

Daren saw our endless-scrolling inbox of replies — and laughed because he remembered I promised to read every single one.

But turns out, I’m LOVING reading all your replies.

Why? Because so many were NOT just about guessing the deck’s name… but you sharing your stories with me.

And many of your replies moved me. Because you shared about moments in your life that moved you. So thank you.

Now if you’re wondering if anyone got the name of the ______ series right…

MANY of you absolutely nailed it.
​

But first… let’s unveil this deck even further with new photos
In my last email to you, I unveiled the new Virt deck’s back design — in a flavor that we last tasted 7 years ago with the SS15.

At the same time…

Remember how I shared that though this deck is NOT a P1… it does have elements inspired from it?

With that, here’s the first photo of the faces to show you what I mean…


​
The new Virtuoso deck features the orbital Icons and Ring introduced with the P1 deck — design that brings new visual dimension to every Cardistry move you do.


​
And if you’re not already familiar with the Icons and Ring…

The signature center Ring from our back designs now passes through to the front, creating a unifying element from back to face…
​
As colorful Icons encircle the Ring in progressively larger arrays…
​
… creating surreal visuals never seen before in a deck of cards.


​
For example…

Spin the cards, and the Icons on the faces swirl to create a “Wagon Wheel Effect” — where the Icons look like they’re rotating in reverse when captured on video.
​
And when you do flips and twirls? A “Birdcage Illusion” is created, where the Ring appears to float in 3D space while surrounding shapes swirl around it.

​
And to take things even further this time around, we’ve…

Subtly enlarged each Icon to give them greater visual presence in every move you do. And…
​
We’ve styled the Icons in fresh ways that give them greater visual contrast — making your Cardistry “pop” more than ever
​
So whether these cards are sitting still on your desk, or moving in your hands…

… they’re simply mesmerizing.
​

I seriously can’t wait for you to hold them in your hands and just take them in.
​
Or for you to put them in your own video… and draw others in yourself.

​
​And remember how I said I’d share “many more photos” with you?
Here’s a gallery with even more photos I didn’t include in this email.

​
​Best of all, this gallery will keep growing with every email I send you. (There’s something special we’ve yet to show you)

And now that we’ve unveiled the new Icons…
​

It’s time to unveil the name of the ______ series and announce the winners.
​
Let’s do this.

​
Is the name of the new series…
​

Memories?

Emotions?

Flavors?

Colors?

​
Or…

​
Atoms?

​
The correct answer is…
​
​Moments.
​
​Your life is made up of millions of moments put together.

So is mine.
​

Moments are unlimited in scope, yet specific in expression.

They mark the memories of when you first watched a Cardistry video that deeply inspired you.

Or when you fell in love with a deck of cards.

Or when you first nailed that move you first thought impossible.

Moments are what give life meaning.
​

(And in my invitation email, I wrote: “Moments that build the future of Cardistry don’t come along every day”)
​

Welcome to Virtuoso Moments —

A series which captures the infinite yet unique moments that make up life… through cards which visually express what words can’t always convey.

With that…

​

Haven't won a deck yet? No worries, because you’ve got another shot.
Because even though the series is named “Moments”…

That’s NOT the name of the deck itself.

​

The name of the deck is:

____N ____T

​
(It’s two words. More clues below!)
​

And if you want to win a signed Virtuoso Moments deck, here’s what to do right now:

Reply to this email with your best guess of what the name of the new deck is (Virtuoso ____N ____T )
​
I’ll pick five people with the correct answer, and announce the winners in my next email
​
The faster you reply, the higher your chances of winning
​
And here are your clues…

The first BIG clue, is that the two words are in my Invite email to you — hiding in plain sight.
​
And if you want an even bigger (and more meaningful) clue, read on 
​
Of course, if you don’t want another clue, then this email safely ends here —

And you can look forward to my next email where I’ll announce the next 5 winners (plus fresh new surprises and unveilings).
​

Still here? Cool, you’re awesome.
​

This next clue… has got to do with an iconic movie from 1989. (Seriously)
Ever heard the quote, “If you build it, they will come”?

It’s drawn from “Field of Dreams” — a movie released 33 years ago.

​
Many people think it’s a “follow your passion and live happily ever after” kinda movie.

It’s not — it’s about something much deeper than that.

​
So… what’s that got to do with the Virtuoso Moments deck?

Well, lots.
​

And to really answer that, let me ask you this question:
​

“Have you ever had something ‘drop’ in your heart that you knew you had to do? And that if you never did… you might regret forever?”

​
I’m not just talking about Cardistry.
​

I mean anything in your life, like:

desiring to attempt something you’ve never done before​
​
wanting to take steps in your life towards a whole new direction​
​
or perhaps… finding the courage to go for something you’re increasingly drawn towards​
​
These are the things which no one quite gets but you (and maybe the ones you’re truly closest to).

They’re the things which people find you crazy for even considering, because the chances of failure are real (along with looking seriously stupid).

I know I’ve had those moments. I still do.

I know what it feels like to step into them… and I also know what it’s like to feel the regret of never taking a single step.

So no, this isn’t about “following your passion”.
It’s much more than that.

Here’s what I mean:

In “Field of Dreams”, the main character (his name’s Ray) decides to buy a field and start a farm.

But before his farming efforts ever take off, he hears a voice (again and again) that tells him,

“Build it, and he will come.”

Ray has no idea what this means. (And people think he’s crazy… because no one can hear the voice but him.)

Then one night, he sees a vision of a baseball field.

And in that moment, he knows he has to build that baseball field — even if he has no clue what will come of it.
​
So, he ends up unearthing a ton of his crops…

Eating into the profits of his farm…

And literally builds a baseball field in the middle of no where.​
​
​Everyone mocks him and thinks he is crazy… except for a few who ALSO see the visions he sees (and eventually, hear the voice he hears).

And so, Ray proceeds to go on an epic adventure where he has to take steps forward… even before he knows WHAT to do or HOW he will do it.

​
I won’t share the ending — it isn’t exactly the point of the movie.

​
​But there’s a reason why… 33 years later… “Field of Dreams” is still considered one of the most inspiring movies ever made.
For me, it expresses how these crazy pursuits in life aren’t ultimately about whether we “succeed” or “fail”.

For more often than not… the most meaningful pursuits come with zero guarantees of certainty.

The only “certainty” we have? Is that of adventure, growth, and the chance to become something more.

More importantly…

What makes them meaningful is that we followed a call…

Took steps forward in courage...

And embraced every moment of that journey.
​
​That we stepped out into the Open… and onto a Court to play this “game” called life.
​
​That we felt the fear… and did it anyway.

​
Of course, I don’t know what’s going on in your life right now…

If there’s a new phase of life you’re about to enter into…
​
If you’re thinking about exploring something you’ve never touched before…
​
Or if you’re looking to create a space to finally step into what you’ve long desired to do…
​
But I do know that whatever it is — these moments are super exciting, yet filled with crazy uncertainty.
​

When I finally watched “Field of Dreams” yesterday after hearing about it for years…
It hit me right in the feels.

Why? Because these moments were very much how Virt began — and still guide us toward where we’re headed next.
​

There’s a quote in the movie, where after building the baseball field, Ray goes,

“I have just created something totally illogical. Am I completely nuts?”

And at Virt, that’s what we talk about so much of the time —

For so much of what we have pursued doesn’t make sense to most people in the “real world”.

​
After all, how does shuffling a deck of cards “change the world”?
​
​
​Yet…

When we see how it connects people (and families!) from all across the globe in such profound ways…

When we hear from people who write to us about how picking up Cardistry changed their life…

And when we look at our own lives and ask ourselves how we forged our closest friendships…
​

Suddenly, this illogical love of Cardistry makes all the sense in the world.

​
It’s changed our worlds at the very least, that’s for sure.

And I hope that stepping into our world has touched your life in some way too.

With that — if you’d like to join us — wouldn’t it be cool if we could build something together?

But hey, I’ll share more in my next email.

That’s all for today’s clue.

Till then, take care, and talk soon!

​
Cheers,
Huron

P.S. If you’ve read till here, I’d like to ask you something personal to get to know you a little better.

Is there “field of dreams” moment going on in your life right now?

Or has there been one that you’ve stepped into, and means something to you?

Hit back (only if you’re comfortable)… because I’d love to hear about it.

​
And to end this note, here’s a Theodore Roosevelt quote on daring greatly that’s inspired me for years:

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

— Theodore Roosevelt
​
​

P.P.S. And since you’re still reading, here’s a little something extra for you:

We’re only halfway through the unveiling.

To give you a hint of what’s next, my next email is about the two things that people have asked us about for years:

“I wish you guys released more than one deck a year.”

And…

“I want to use my Cardistry decks all the time, but I wish they weren’t in that expensive $18-$25 range.”

In other words, beyond announcing the next round of winners… I have a few more surprises waiting for you.

(And to everyone who said they “love being on this email list”… thank you. It’s encouraging and means a ton to me! I love writing these emails for you too.)

See you in the next email!
