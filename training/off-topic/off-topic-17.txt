Here are this week's five links that are worth your time:

1. freeCodeCamp just published a new Full Stack Web Development course, taught by two of our most popular instructors. This beginner course will teach you HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, Node.js, MongoDB, and more.

2. If you're interested in working in the field of cloud computing, this new course will help you pass the Microsoft 365 Fundamentals (MS-900) Certification. In it, long-time freeCodeCamp contributor Andrew Brown shares how he passed the exam, and covers all of its material.

3. Learn how to use CSS Flexbox to make responsive webpages that look good on any device size.

4. The Kotlin programming language is a popular alternative to Java. You can use Kotlin to do many of the same things, such as build Android apps or code for the Java Virtual Machine. But Kotlin offers a more contemporary developer experience. freeCodeCamp just published an in-depth Kotlin course to teach you about functions, types, logical operators, and Object-Oriented Programming. (14 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-kotlin-complete-course/

5. Hacktoberfest was a blast. Jessica oversaw freeCodeCamp's DeveloperQuiz.org GitHub repository. She QA'd and merged more than 360 pull requests from volunteer code contributors. Her tips to other people who want to maintain open source projects: “Lead with patience, empathy, and kindness.” These are her insights from the past 31 days of coding.

Quote of the Week: “Just crawl it.” — text from the top of Nike's robots.txt file on their website. (robots.txt is the file Google's crawlers look at when they're deciding how to index a website.)

Happy coding.
