Quoc, it's official. On December 6th, Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock will face off in a runoff election against his opponent, Herschel Walker.

This is the 2nd time that the fate of the Senate rests in Georgia‚Äôs hands ‚Äì but this time around, we've got less than a month to ensure voters show up ONCE AGAIN and vote to keep Senator Warnock in office.

We've got no time to waste, Quoc ‚Äì rush a donation of $10 or whatever you can to BLM PAC and help us fuel Georgia runoff election efforts >>
DONATE $10 >>
DONATE OTHER AMOUNT >>
Herschel Walker has proved time and again that he‚Äôs got no interest in helping Black folks‚Ä¶and, let's not even get into how proud he is to have the support of both Mitch McConnell AND Donald Trump. We HATE to see it üôÑ.

From his ridiculous anti-abortion stances (no exceptions for rape, health of the mother, etc) to the fact that he thinks that defunding the police is a ‚Äúridiculous idea,‚Äù it is clear that Walker does not care about building a democracy that is fair and free for ALL people.

We've got less than a month until the runoffs in Georgia. Let's get to work.
