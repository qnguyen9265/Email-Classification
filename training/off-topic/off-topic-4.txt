Hi,

After I interviewed some of the world leaders at APEC, I got to explore Thailand’s beautiful capital city.

It turns out that Thai food is amazing (and more than a little spicy). But one of the best things about being in Bangkok was traveling in a TukTuk. These nippy little scooter-carts are all over Bangkok and they’re the perfect way to get around.

Have you seen this video on Street-Smart Spanish?
Our new channel for Spanish learners is full of interesting interviews with Mexicans. We cover all sorts of topics so you can get a real sense of modern Mexican culture. The videos are all in Spanish — a great way to practice listening — with subtitles below in case you need a little help.
​

What do Mexicans love about Mexico?
Who better to ask about Mexico than the people who live there? We asked Mexicans what they love best about their country and they couldn’t wait to spill the beans.
