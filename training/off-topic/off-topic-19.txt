Hi,

It’s been a while since I got my ears cleaned properly so I took a trip to 乐享汗蒸头疗 Spa to get their famous ear cleaning procedure. Do you think this was a quick 5-minute in-and-out job?
​
​No way!

This procedure includes a sauna, massage, vibration - oh yes and cleaning a heap of gunk from my ears. Like many practitioners, these guys have elevated Chinese ear cleaning to an artform.

Perhaps everyone should try this strangely pleasurable experience at least once in their lives.

Black Guy Orders Food in Yiddish And Astonishes Us All!
Me, Nate and my YouTuber friend @Frankie Light couldn’t believe our luck when we got to go back to Hasidic neighborhoods in New York during Sukkot (the Jewish festival of booths.) This is a wonderful festival with food, dancing, prayer and a huge street party.

And, of course, it threw up plenty of chances for us all to practice our Yiddish.

Thanks to Rabbi Gershon Avtzon for giving us an amazing guided tour of Chabad World Headquarters. We learned a lot while making this video — I’m sure you will too.
