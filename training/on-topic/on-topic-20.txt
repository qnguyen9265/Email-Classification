It is a well-rounded and thoroughly tested design that has existed as part of Mk1YoYos for nearly 4 years now. It has a comfortably optimized profile shape, a fun hub, a thumb grind lip, and plenty of tiny details to appreciate. This version increases the axle length from 8 to 10mm, improving durability.

KnuckleYo by Zero Gravity Return Tops!

KnuckleYo by Zero Gravity Return Tops
The Zero Gravity team was having some fun with other skill toys and found a knuckle roller in their hand. Suddenly they had a thought… What if this was also a yo-yo? And the idea of the KnuckleYo was born.

KnuckleYo by Zero Gravity Return Tops

They ran into many challenges along the way. It took lots of trial and error to find a design that made both a great knuckle roller and a fun functioning yo-yo. They tested different materials and bearing sizes until the found the combo that worked just right.

KnuckleYo by Zero Gravity Return Tops
In the end they found the best combinations possible and made their “what if” a reality. Is the KnuckleYo a yo-yo that turns into a knuckle roller or a knuckle roller that turns into a yo-yo? You will have to let us know! Either way the result is a fantastic new product that brings together two different skill toy communities and lets each of them learn a fun new way to play!
