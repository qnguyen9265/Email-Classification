Y'all know the drill...
Throw some leftovers in the toaster oven and enjoy 15% off our entire catalog (minus the Nexus) from now through the end of Monday. It's our best sale of the year and a great time stock up on thoughtful Christmas presents for friends, family, and, of course, yourself.

Discount applied automatically at checkout, no code or anything required.

And beyond the normal catalog, we're also offering the discount on remaining clearance inventory with the old clips (Side Clicks, Slim Bolt Actions) and the brand new DLC Special Bolt Actions with anodized color accents. More on that later.

About holiday shipping
Our shop is closed until Monday, November 28 so please allow extra time for shipping and Customer Service inquiries. We will do our best to prioritize 2-Day and Next Day Air orders but, when this type of build up happens, we can't guarantee all orders will be shipped on Monday.

To ensure delivery by Christmas, place your order by:

Ground Shipping – 10am CST, Wednesday 12/14
2-Day Air – 10am CST, Tuesday 12/20
Next Day Air – 10am Tuesday 12/21
