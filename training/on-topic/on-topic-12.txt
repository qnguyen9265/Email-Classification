Swordfish update! ‚öîÔ∏èüêü

As many of you know we aimed to have the Swordfish available by the end of October, following our initial release at Blade Show West. Our initial build was a total of 200 units but a combination of anodizing and machining issues caused us to fail nearly half of them.

We went back to the drawing board and revised our manufacturing process so that each and every Swordfish blade and handle were consistently meeting our quality standards.

Today, we are happy to announce that Swordfish production is underway and we aim to have an official online release by year end. ü§©
