Three signs
you’re being scammed:
1. You're told to act immediately | Impostors want you to act before you have time to think and may pretend to be a relative in need, a utility company or even Bank of America. 2. They ask for your personal info or codes | Never share codes or personal information when contacted unexpectedly by phone, text, email, computer alert or social media. 3. You're asked to pay in an unusual way | Be wary if asked to pay by wire transfer, gift card codes or payment apps.
Zelle®
Be aware of a payment scam1
We may confirm unusual activity via text, but we will never contact you to request that you send money using Zelle® or share a code to resolve fraud. These requests are likely impostors trying to trick you.
Don’t get scammed
Remember, if it plays on your emotions or
sounds too good to be true, it’s likely a scam.
