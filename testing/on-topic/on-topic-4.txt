Same song, different dance
Last month we officially hired someone that's been helping us do custom work for a while – Christoper Barrett AKA "Bear" AKA "El Oso." Y'all may have seen his work in one of the Facebook groups or on Instagram and, needless to say, we think he has a knack for coming up with special treatments.

For his inaugural Limited Release drop, Bear suggested a new style we're calling the Void. Starting with a Titanium Bolt Action, each pen is treated to develop a unique design and color palette and then hand sanded to expose the raw material underneath.

And although we say this a lot, each one is extremely unique – differing both in terms of the pattern and "void" location. Check 'em out:


But that's not all...
Kevin also finally got his hands on some Superconductor material and was able to do a batch of Bolt Action Tips and Tops and, for the first time ever, Full Superconductor Bolt Action pens which are unreal.

And, after getting some good feedback on previous Shop Series drops, Bear put together a batch of Forced Patina Slim Side Clicks by intentionally distressing bronze pens to give them an old-world look and feel.

Pictures and links for each model are below but remember, adding something to your cart doesn't reserve the item. If there's one you have your eye on it's best to act quickly so you don't miss out.

Note: We had some issues with the first batch of Slim Side Clicks and apologize to anyone who was inconvenienced. Here's a post that covers exactly what happened and how we're addressing it →
